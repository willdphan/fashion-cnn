# CNN for Fashion MNIST Dataset

This repository uses `PyTorch`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`.

## Description

This deep learning image classification model that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify different types of clothing items in images. The model is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories, and evaluated on a test set of 10,000 images.

The final accuracy achieved by the model is reported, indicating how well the model is able to classify clothing items. Check out the script [here](CNN_Fashion_Classifier_on_MNIST.ipynb).
